      Unusual for my style of play

      Although my usual game is grind out and play closed until my opponent slips up, I really did enjoy taking this attack on. To be fair I am playing 500 elo below my peak so...

      2.e5 with a beautiful attack!

      Similar to the previous game, I ended up opening the position and attacking. Not sure what the thought process was behind hanging the rook on a8?? Although I missed the Nxb5 idea, cramming his pieces together and mating the black king was very satisfying. I think I'll study 2.e5 more!

    <div style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; color: black; margin-bottom: 10px;">
      Almost got caught up in some frenzy

        This was a close save. The knight and queen combo did pull me back from the brink. Not sure why my brain decided to backfire on me, but glad my opponent's brain decided to do the same as well.

        I cannot tell you how long I've waited for some nerd who just mugs stuff up to play the open sicilian against my averback dragon. My heart rate kept increasing until I saw Bh6 on the board! AAAAA!
