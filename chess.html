              Although my usual game is grind out and play closed until my opponent slips up, I really did enjoy taking this attack on. To be fair I am playing 500 elo below my peak so...

              Similar to the previous game, I ended up opening the position and attacking. Not sure what the thought process was behind hanging the rook on a8?? Although I missed the Nxb5 idea, cramming his pieces together and mating the black king was very satisfying. I think I'll study 2.e5 more!
