        I've graduated from <a target="blank" href= "https://www.iith.ac.in/">IIT Hyderabad</a> with a Bachelor of Technology in 2024, setting up to join <a target="blank" href= "https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a> this Fall '24!

        During my undergrad, I've worked with <a target="blank" href= "https://borthakurayon.github.io/">Dr. Ayon Borthkaur</a> to create an algorithm which trains neural networks without the need for backpropagation. I extensively studied <strong>local learning, few shot learning, and few epoch learning</strong>, incorporating the algorithm with all these features.
        I've had the pleasure to work with <a target="blank" href= "https://people.iith.ac.in/sumohana/">Prof. Sumohana Channappayya</a> on digital video compression. I came up with a novel transform inspired by field dynamics which shows improved performance over the traditional DCT, especially in texture rich regions.
        Since then I've explored tons of graph compression algorithms with <a target="blank" href= "https://people.iith.ac.in/shashankvatedka/html/home.html">Dr. Shashank Vatedka</a> and more recently, worked on very high dimensional data compression, aiming to reduce transmission to less than 1 bit per dimension.

        During the first few years of my virtual undergrad (caused by the pandemic), I worked at <a target="blank" href= "https://www.anitechsolutions.com/">Anitech Solutions</a> mentored by <a target="blank" href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/adnolan/?originalSubdomain=ie">CEO Andrew Nolan</a> where I worked with the Engineering team and Business Analysts to deliver and elaborate on functional and non functional requirements of <strong>KnowCost for JIRA</strong>.
        For the summer of 2023, I worked at <a target="blank" href= "https://www.oracle.com/">Oracle India</a> as an software intern, where I helped build on Redwood dependency analyzer for Redwood Infrastructure Components and Services (RADAR).

        When I'm not reading, I'm
        <ul>
            <li>watching/playing Tennis and Football and Cricket matches, and newly F1, and newly newly Ice Hockey (Go Canucks Go!), analysis and everything else that surrounds these beautiful sports. If you are a Djokovic or a Chelsea fan, how do I not know you already!</li>
            <li>quizzing and conducting quizzes, debating, and binging random shows</li>
            <li>exploring new places, new activities, and learning random facts about randomest things under and beyond the sun </li>
         </ul>

        I love giving back to the society in whatever way I can, be it through tutoring underprivileged children or developing reading material for the disadvantaged. Multiple Teaching Assistantships at Google Research, NPTEL and IIT Hyderabad have helped me gain invaluable experience, learning the subjects itself better and learning how to help people learn. No doubt, the best way to learn is to teach. I also believe it is important to be a contributor to the Research Community and have reviewed and volunteered for several conferences like NeurIPS '23, COLT '23, ICML '24.

        I've represented IIT Hyderabad at <strong>Nihilanth</strong>, the Inter-IIT-IIM Quiz Championship, held at IIM Calcutta in January 2019, and at <strong>The Inter IIT Cultural Meet</strong> held at IIT Bombay in Decmber 2019, and at <strong>The Inter IIT Tech Meet</strong> held by IIT Guwahati in March 2021. Those were couple of most exciting weekends of my life, a congregation of some of the most interesting bunch of amazing people.
